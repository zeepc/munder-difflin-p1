 Paper company

A website for a  small paper company with a wide range of products for both businesses and individuals.

### *APPROACH* 
In this project, I wanted to make a site that would not be cluttered by words and can still convey the company's mission.
The second section has a wide selection of pictures featuring paper products for everyone, and for every use. 

### *TECHNICAL APPROACH* <enter>
For this project, I wanted to implement a little bit of everything we've learned in class thus far. 
Because CSS, keyframes and animations are not my strength, I concentrated in those aspects of the project for the sake of practice 
and to achieve a better understanding of these.
